'Never Happened Before': WMO Finds Past 10 Years Have Been 10 Hottest on Record,,collapse,"


The following submission statement was provided by /u/Portalrules123:

---

SS: Related to climate collapse as the World Meteorological Organization has determined that the past ten years have indeed been the 10 hottest years on record. This demonstrates the accelerating nature of climate change, as while many of the warmest years have been post-2000 it has never been the last ten years in sequence that were the ten hottest. Considering how many positive feedback loops have been fired and that 2025 is looking to be at least one of the hottest on record, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the last ten years became the hottest on record perpetually into the future. We shall see, but the odds are looking good as climate chaos continues.

'Never Happened Before': WMO Finds Past 10 Years Have Been 10 Hottest on Record,,collapse,"""While a single year above 1.5¬∞C of warming does not indicate that the long-term temperature goals of the Paris agreement are out of reach""

and here's why apparently?, this is what they are also saying?

""As of 2023, two other greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide, also reached levels unseen in the last 800,000 years.

""Over the course of 2024, our oceans continued to warm, sea levels continued to rise, and acidification increased. The frozen parts of Earth's surface, known as the cryosphere, are melting at an alarming rate: glaciers continue to retreat, and Antarctic sea ice reached the second-lowest extent ever recorded.""

Not mentioned was that sulphur was removed from shipping fuels, the Earth's albedo is dimming, terrestrial ecosystems are not absorbing much CO2 anymore, thermokarst lakes created in melting permafrost are creating methane, and scientists are looking for methane leaks when natural gas production is accelerating.

BUT IF YOU DONATE! the great horns will sound the alarm!, and the massive carbon sucking unicorns will be on their way to save us! Or someone could explain how we are going to remove hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 from the atmosphere faster than the feed backs and temperatures are accelerating.

SS: Related to climate collapse as, unlike other effects of climate change that can at least partly be mitigated or avoided, like sea level rise, heat is like the ‚Äòfinal boss‚Äô that is coming for all of us as climate change accelerates and positive feedback loops fire. While especially deadly for vulnerable populations like children and the elderly, there will soon come a time when even healthy adults won‚Äôt be able to withstand the heat across wide swathes of the planet, and the 2003 European heat wave will seem mild in comparison. I suppose there is air conditioning, but increasing that tends to increase heat and emissions in yet another positive feedback loop, plus for society to function people have to be able to go outside at least some of the time. Expect heat-related deaths to exponentially spike as climate chaos continues.

'Heat is the final boss. Heat is a different beast': The planetary peril no one will be able to avoid,,collapse,"> Indeed, there is some reason to believe that from a pure temperature perspective, temperature-related mortality has in fact decreased in the past decades, not just because of improved adaptation, but also because of warmer winters.


This is precisely what I‚Äôve been thinking. For all of human history, *winter* was the season which humans and societies had to prepare for. *Winter* brought hardship and required pre-planning.

In our new climate paradigm, its clear to me that *summer* will become the season of dread (if it hasn‚Äôt already) for the world at large. Winter will take a back seat in the collective cultural consciousness as it becomes more of a ‚Äúsummer, hyper-summer, summer, fall/spring‚Äù seasonal outlook rather than a ‚Äúspring, summer, fall, winter‚Äù outlook. 

Winter, when it does decide to come around, will probably give people the same feeling of release as spring does now for those who still feel the bitter cold of winter.

We‚Äôll miss the days where the winter season was what we dreaded."

SS: The article discusses how the evolving threat of H5N1 is becoming increasingly difficult to manage as the virus adapts to mammals. This is related to collapse because despite continued monitoring, the likelihood of a pandemic has grown, with human cases becoming more severe. The virus is present in wildlife and agriculture globally, and ‚ÄúThere is absolutely no chance of containment, and we now have to think about mitigation and monitoring.‚Äù Have a nice day.

The warnings people make is that the more exposure to humans catching the disease from farm animals - which can happen because the virus can bind to receptor cells in our lungs and so working closely with animals increases the viral load you breathe in - the more people catching it that way increases the chance of mutation that allows it to bind to the cells in our upper respiratory system and spread it more effectively."
